###Project (Getting and Cleaning Data) ###

The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does these things:

1. Creates a Directory and makes it the working directory. 
```{r}
setwd("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning")
```
2. It downloads the file from URL address, store at a local drive and then unzips it. 
```{r}
unzip(zipfile="./data/run.zip", exdir="./data")
```
3. It reads the eight files into R including. 
+activity_labels.txt
+features.txt
+X_train.txt 
+X_test.txt 
+y_train.txt
+y_test.txt
+subject_train
+subject_test
```{r}
activity_labels <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
features <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
X_train <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", col.names=features[,2])
X_test  <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", col.names=features[,2])
y_train <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt")
y_test <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
subject_train <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
subject_test <- read.table("Y:/personal/personal/Work/teaching/Data Science/Coursera/Data Cleaning/data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
```
4. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Generate new variable 'set to identify which set the observation is coming from. sort=FALSE is used to stack all the train set and then test set.
```{r}
X_train$set<-"train"
X_test$set<-"test"
MergeData<-merge(X_train, X_test, all=TRUE, sort=FALSE)
```
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
```{r}
MeanStdData<-MergeData[,grep("mean|std", names(MergeData), value="TRUE")]
```
6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Create a new variable 'activity' and 'subject' to include activity names (y) and subject identification (subject)
```{r}
MeanStdData$activity<-rep(0, nrow(MeanStdData))
MeanStdData$activity<-c(y_train$V1, y_test$V1)
MeanStdData$subject<-c(subject_train$V1, subject_test$V1)
```

7.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#Change variable name from V2 to activity for the better label

```{r}
library(dplyr)
activity_labels<-rename(activity_labels,  Activity=V2)
y_train<-rename(y_train,  activity=V1)
y_test<-rename(y_test,  activity=V1)
subject_train<-rename(subject_train,  subject=V1)
subject_test<-rename(subject_test,  subject=V1)
```

8. From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

```{r}
Mean_for_each_activity <- MeanStdData %>% group_by(activity, subject) %>%summarise_each(funs(mean), -activity)
Mean_for_each_activity$activity[Mean_for_each_activity$activity==1]<-"WALKING"
Mean_for_each_activity$activity[Mean_for_each_activity$activity==2]<-"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
Mean_for_each_activity$activity[Mean_for_each_activity$activity==3]<-"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
Mean_for_each_activity$activity[Mean_for_each_activity$activity==4]<-"SITTING"
Mean_for_each_activity$activity[Mean_for_each_activity$activity==5]<-"STANDING"
Mean_for_each_activity$activity[Mean_for_each_activity$activity==6]<-"LAYING"

write.table(Mean_for_each_activity, "tidy.txt", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

```
